# College Assignments
This is a repository for projects I worked on in college that I felt like sharing!

**Coming Soon - Fourth Year Assignments!**

# First Year - Coffee Shop

This was a project that was done before we were introduced to any form of object oriented programming. It's a
menu driven system that uses loyalty cards to determine when individuals are entitled to free coffees.

# Third Year - Palindrome

This was my first project in C and is a simple checker for determining if a number is in fact a palindrome. The checker can be
controlled with a set of keyboard commands.

# Third Year - Distributed File Sharing System (Sockets)

This is a project which uses object oriented principles with Java sockets, Threads, some design patterns and JavaFX for a GUI.
It functions as a file sharing system where multiple clients can connect to a server to upload and download files. Clients can
download mp3 files and play them locally on their machines. To see the code in action, you will have to ensure the pathways are
updated for your machine.

# Third Year - Distributed File Sharing System (RMI)

This is essentially the same as the Sockets file sharing system, however it uses Java RMI in place of sockets.
