# Storage Controller

The Storage Controller, formed the basis of the entire platform. Since each Controller was an isolated piece of software, they did not all share the exact same directory. This meant that so called critical files, could not be shared all that easily between each controller. So as a result, the Storage Controller was created. The goal of this was to provision a common storage layer that each controller could access for both upload of new files and download of existing ones. This worked extremely well in the context of the Terraform Controller where it would upload the kube config file it generated from the cluster it made and the Kubernetes Controller would then download that kube config file to use in the interaction with the cluster. MinIO was used as the storage layer with its S3 API being implemented so that theoretically, the storage layer could be agnostic to whatever the underlying storage provider was.
