# Kubernetes Controller

The Kubernetes Controller is what deploys all the associated tools with the CI/CD platform. It manages this by downloading the kube config from the Storage Controller that the Terraform Controller uploaded to it. Kube Control is used to set up the prerequisites and we also use the `rollout`command to essentially health check the cluster and the tools. So we initially health check the cluster by checking on the Cillium operator that is running as part of a DOK8s cluster. Then for each tool that's deployed (Artifactory, Concourse CI and Sonarqube), we get any Helm Preqs, then we deploy the tool with Helm and health check with the previously described Kube Control command. Once all the tools are deployed, an Nginx Ingress is deployed. This leads to the only real manual step of the process which is ensuring the domain name in use has A records pointing to the ingress and the various routes that are set up to point to the newly created platform.
