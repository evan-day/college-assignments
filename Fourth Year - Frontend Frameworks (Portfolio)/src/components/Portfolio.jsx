                        Venice Art Guide have an intuitive app for learning all about the amazing art work around Venice. With Google Maps integration, users of the app can find the quickest path to the work they want to see. The site was built by hand over a period of a month on their own AWS account. Eventually, they migrated to our account as part of our moving clients into our new support program. We had also just released new security solutions for DDOS mitigation that they avail of for free as part of their annual hosting.<br/>

                        As part of my degree, I am undertaking a research project that contributes 25% to my overall final grade. In this project, I will be answering the following question. Can I build an automation platform for the creation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines? I have made great progress on answering this question and I am looking forward to delivering the final project in the middle of 2019.
