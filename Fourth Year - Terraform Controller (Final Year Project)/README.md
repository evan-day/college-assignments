# Terraform Controller

The Terraform Controller is responsible for automating the infrastructure component of the CI/CD Platform. It does so by using Terraform to create a Kubernetes cluster on the chosen cloud provider, in this case it's DigitalOcean. Once the cluster is created, the Terraform Controller uses the Storage Controller to upload a kube config file. In a way, this design means that any other cloud provider could be substituted and once that kubeconfig could be generated, it can be used by the platform. This really helps in one of the overall themes of the project - cloud agnosticism. While the proof of concept code does not directly implement it, since we do use Kubernetes as the layer for app deployment, theoretically any conformant Kubernetes cluster can enable the build out of the platform.
